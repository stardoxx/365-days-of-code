# Rules 
1.You can work on anything and everthing because the main aim of doing this is to devlope consistency.

2.Just for the repo and get started.

3.The time and code that you put in 365 days of code dosen't include your standard course work or random tutorials.During this 
time you are suppose to code whater you want, you can finish your previous incomplete projects that never saw the ligth of the last commit or build the next popular app of your generation. 

4.Upadte the log daily(it's okay if you somehow skip a day,just don't give up)and try not to skip more than one day in a row.
