# 365-days-of-code

# My Name 
This repo is for those who lack consistency in their coding workflow but fells the need to code daily not only to
improve their skills but because it's simply fun to code.

365 days of code is nothing but simple log based procedure where you devote atleast an hour to code and update the log on this repo. 

# Rules 
1.You can work on anything and everthing because the main aim of doing this is to devlope consistency.<br>(I would prefer set a To-Do list on the things you would like to work on like "I would work mainly in web dev with stack Python and Java Script and a bit of competitive coding using Python/C")

2.Just for the repo and get started.

3.The time and code that you put in 365 days of code dosen't include your standard course work or random tutorials.During this 
time you are suppose to code whater you want, you can finish your previous incomplete projects that never saw the ligth of the last commit or build the next popular app of your generation. 

4.Upadte the log daily(it's okay if you somehow skip a day,just don't give up)and try not to skip more than one day in a row.
